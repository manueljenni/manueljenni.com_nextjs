Me and my girlfriend booked a spontaneous trip back to Asia - this time with Swiss in Business Class. After having flown Etihad for the past few years, I didn't expect much from a Western airline as their business products are typically quite outdated and lacking compared to those offered by Middle Eastern and Asian carriers.

But I was surprised - it was actually quite nice! Even though the food was somewhat lacking as expected, the hard product was decent and the crew made up for it with their nice attitude. The lounge in Zurich was also very nice.

### The route

Because we booked this trip only a few hours before departure, we couldn't take the most direct route. We started off in London (where we live), but our flights originated from Stockholm (ARN), so we took an early morning flight there to start our journey.

Then we took the following route: **Stockholm (ARN) - Zurich (ZRH) - Singapore (SIN) - Bangkok (BKK)**.

### Stockholm - Zurich

The first flight is not even worth mentioning - Business Class within Europe is a very forgettable thing. The lounge (SAS Business Lounge) in Stockholm was very full and dirty, with only a few food options. The only cool thing was that they had the stuff so you could make your own Chai Latte.

The flight was nothing special too - in Business, you just get the middle seat blocked which meant we had a whole row. There were some food and drinks.

### Zurich - Singapore

After landing in Zurich, we went to the Senator Lounge at gates E. This was really nice, one of the better lounges I've visited so far. It was very clean and quite empty, and they also had some food.
