Me and my girlfriend booked a spontaneous trip back to Asia - this time with Swiss in Business Class. After having flown Etihad for the past few years, I didn't expect much from a Western airline as their business products are typically quite outdated and lacking compared to those offered by Middle Eastern and Asian carriers.

But I was surprised - it was actually quite nice! Even though the food was somewhat lacking as expected, the hard product was decent and the crew made up for it with their nice attitude. The lounge in Zurich was also very nice.

### The route

Because we booked this trip only a few hours before departure, we couldn't take the most direct route. We started off in London (where we live), but our flights originated from Stockholm (ARN), so we took an early morning flight there to start our journey.

Then we took the following route: **Stockholm (ARN) - Zurich (ZRH) - Singapore (SIN) - Bangkok (BKK)**.

### Stockholm - Zurich

The first flight is not even worth mentioning - Business Class within Europe is a very forgettable thing. The lounge (SAS Business Lounge) in Stockholm was very full and dirty, with only a few food options. The only cool thing was that they had the stuff so you could make your own Chai Latte.

The flight was nothing special too - in Business, you just get the middle seat blocked which meant we had a whole row. There were some food and drinks.

### Zurich - Singapore

After landing in Zurich, we went to the Senator Lounge at Gates E. It was really nice, one of the better lounges I've visited so far. The lounge was very clean and quite empty, and they also served some food. There was no a la carte menu, but they had some dishes and a buffet section. There was also self-serve alcohol and a cool coffee machine.

### The seat

Swiss operates their 777 flights in a 2-2-1 configuration. I really don't like this - I much prefer the 1-2-1 that other airlines have. If you don't get one of the "throne seats" (Swiss calls them "privacy seats"), you might have to climb over your neighbour to get out. Privacy is also almost non-existent, which for me is one of the main selling points for flying Business. Those seats can cost up to $200 extra, unless you're a Senator or HON Circle member.

But I was sitting in 15K, one of the throne seats. There was plenty of space - I could keep my laptop open on the side while eating.

Boarding was quite quick, and there was a welcome drink (champagne, juice or water) before takeoff. We also got to choose breakfast options. I also had a look at the amenity kit which was nothing interesting, some weird red socks and a toothbrush amongst other things.

### Food & service

The service is where the differene between Middle Eastern and Western airlines becomes very apparent. Even though the cabin crew was very nice, the service wasn't just personal at all. It felt more like Economy than Business - seems like Middle Eastern Business Class is more comparable to Western First class.

For example, when food was served, they started walking from
