Okay, so what did I do in 2022? 

- I moved to Bangkok, Thailand which is where I spent of of my time this year. Bangkok is the only place where I feel like I'm home so that was pretty nice. I also made a bunch of new friends and explored new places. I also spent more time with my extended family (who lives in BKK).
- I started to work at Mileways as a developer. For the first time I was actually passionate about work; I was really motivated to build new features and develop the product. 
- I travelled a lot: I was on **54 flights**, covering almost 160'000 km (which is almost **4 times around the earth**) and visited **11 countries**. I met up with some really nice people in Singapore, Los Angeles, London, Japan, Korea...
- My freelance content writing business got some traction - I started working with some long-term high-volume clients which really helped the business grow.
- I also started working on a bunch of side projects like this website (now rebuilt with NextJS 13, which also came out this year!) and stuff like apps and mini web-apps.
