Seems like it's 2023 already! 2022 was over so fast - I don't think I've ever had a year
before that felt so short. Which I guess is a good thing? I did a bunch of stuff and was
never bored.

## What did I do in 2022?

Okay, so what did I do in 2022?

- I moved to Bangkok, Thailand which is where I spent of of my time this year. Bangkok is
  the only place where I feel like I'm home so that was pretty nice. I also made a bunch
  of new friends and explored new places. I also spent more time with my extended family
  (who lives in BKK).
- I started to work at Mileways as a developer. For the first time I was actually
  passionate about work; I was really motivated to build new features and develop the
  product.
- I travelled a lot: I was on **54 flights**, covering almost 160'000 km (which is almost
  **4 times around the earth**) and visited **11 countries**. I met up with some really
  nice people in Singapore, Los Angeles, London, Japan, Korea...
- My freelance content writing business got some traction - I started working with some
  long-term high-volume clients which really helped the business grow.
- I also started working on a bunch of side projects like this website (now rebuilt with
  NextJS 13, which also came out this year!) and stuff like apps and mini web-apps.

So what are the main takeaways from last year?

For me, 2022 showed me the importance of **interpersonal relationships**. Even though I
had a very successful year career-wise, what brought me the most happiness was making new
friends, travelling with people and just sharinag happiness with others.

Travelling to many different places has also helped me in being to be much more creative:
I had so many ideas this year for things I want to do, software I want to build and new
hobbies I want to learn. For me, this is why I travel - it's not all that much about
getting to know different cultures and places, it's just the general sense of novelty that
keeps me excited.

Of course 2022 wasn't perfect. I've faced many challenges over the course of the past
year:

- Moving abroad and starting a new life at the same time as starting a new job definitely
  wasn't the smartest choice. Just doing either one of those things is a challenge; and
  doing both at the same time definitely caused me some unnecessary stress and anxiety.

- Travelling can also be stressful. I took a lot of short trips (weekend trips from Europe
  to Bangkok and Los Angeles) because I tried to do too many things at once: Travel but
  still keep working on my 4 different jobs, attend university and also keep building my
  side projects. Bad idea! Slowing down is important - and leads to better work as well.
  Something I'll keep in mind for 2023.

- In 2022, I tried to literally do _everything_ - which is simply not possible. It's
  important to focus on a select few things at the same time and just ignore the others.

## What are my plans for 2023?

First, I'm going to start a **new job** again! I'll be working as a consultant in tech
starting February. I'll be advising and supporting clients with their software projects.
I'm excited! This is something I've never done before and I'll definitely learn a lot.

I'm also officially cutting ties with Switzerland! I'm **getting rid of my Swiss
residency** and then I'll be a proper digital nomad! I plan to travel quite a bit in 2023;
mostly in Asia with a few trips to Europe to meet people and for university.

My plans for the first few months of the year are to go back to Thailand (I'll probably
rent another apartment there to use as my home base), as well as Hong Kong and Japan. I'm
also looking forward to finally going to China!

I've also got quite a few ideas for personal projects I want to build - like a finance /
bookkeeping app for digital nomads, or a travel app. I've been following a few "**Building
in Public**" projects recently and really want to try this out too.

I also want to make an effort to better my **health**; such as sleeping and eating enough
(and healthy), as well as exercising regularly.

Furthermore, I plan to **document my life even more** - just for myself, so I'll be able
to remember my life as a young adult when I'm older. Nowdays it's so easy - we all have
phones with cameras, laptops with internet access, drones etc. that makes it very easy to
capture our thoughts and memories. Part of this is taking (and curating) more and higher
quality photos & videos, as well as writing more.

That's it! Happy New Year everyone!
