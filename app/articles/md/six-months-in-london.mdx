For the past six months, I've been living in London. Here are some of my thoughts & pictures.

## Why London?

Why should anyone consider living in London? For me, it's the best city in Europe. It's the only city that has somewhat of an international vibe, like something that you'd get in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo or Singapore. This leads to a lot of diversity, which I think is really nice - tons of different food options, people from all over the world, and different things to do. It also has a somewhat decent skyline, hard (if not impossible) to find in Europe.

### What area to live in?

I rented a studio around five minutes away from Paddington Station, which is a great location. It's close to Hyde Park, and it's also close to the tube, which is great for getting around the city. The tube makes it really easy to get around the city (if it runs - more about that later). My flat was close to Merchant Square, a new development with restaurants and a nice canal to walk around. There was even a big WeWork location there!

It doesn't really matter where you live, as long as it's in close proximity to a tube station. If you're on the Elizabeth line, it'll make your life a lot easier, as it's a new line that runs through the city and is a lot faster and offers more comfort than the other lines. Also, you probably want to live in either Zone 1 or 2, as that's where the main "city area" is. Why bother living in London if you're not _actually_ living in London?

### Working space - WeWork

I was working remotely, so I didn't have to go to an office. Still, I like to work from places other than home, because it can get quite boring to stay in the same environment all day. Fortunately, London has many coworking spaces! I went with WeWork which has the most locations, but there are also other options. There are over 50 different locations, and they all offer free coffee & drinks (and beer if you're into that)! They are kind of hit and miss though - some of them are amazing, super big and with cool facilities, while others are just a small room with a few desks.

Here are my favourite locations:

- **10 York Road (near Waterloo station)**: This is the "flagship" location, and it's huge. It has a gym, a rooftop bar, and a lot of different areas to work in. The best thing about this location is the view - it's right next to the Thames, and you can see the London Eye and Big Ben from the windows. All the floors have floor to ceiling windows and let in a lot of natural light. It's right next to Waterloo station, so it's easy to get to.
- **The Monument**: This location is located in the City of London and what makes it stand out is the rooftop terrace. You get unobstructed views of the Shard & the Walkie Talkie, and it's accessible from both Bank and Monument stations. They also don't really care if you bring guests as an All Access member (which you're not supposed to do). They also have a "quiet space" room with screens to connect your laptop to.
- **30 Churchill Place (Canary Wharf)**: Another huge location with 6 floors for All Access Members, lots of open space and close to many restaurants. I also feel like this location is less busy than some of the other ones just because it's so big, so you'll always find a place to work in.

### British Food - nope!

Didn't even eat that once! London is a big city with tons of great food options. There are a lot of different cuisines, and you can find most things that you'd want. I ate lots of Italian and Asian food - here are some of my favourite places:

- **Eataly**: Italian food market with multiple restaurants. They have a great selection of Italian food, and of course you can also buy tons of Italian products there. They're next to Liverpool Street station, so it's easy to get to.
- **Padella**: Great Italian restaurant near Borough Market. They have amazing pasta, and it's not too expensive either. They don't take reservations, so you'll have to wait in line - and that line is long, it could take _hours_ to get a table. There is an app that you can use to get in line, but you have to be within a certain radius of the restaurant to join the queue.
- **Din Tai Fung**: Taiwanese restaurant serving their world-famous soup dumplings among other dishes. They have a few locations in London, and they're all great. They even have a vegetarian menu! My favourite dishes: Mushroom & Edamame Noodles, Vegetable Dumplings & Dou Miao with Garlic.
- **San Carlo Group**: Italian restaurant group with multiple locations in London. They have great food, and the service is always amazing. Some of their restaurants serve "Cichetti", which are small Italian dishes that you can share. So make sure to order more than one!
- **Dozo**: Japanese restaurant serving sushi and other Japanese dishes. They have a great selection of vegetarian dishes, and the food is really good. They have two locations, one in Soho and one in South Kensington. It gets busy though and they don't take reservations, so you usually have to wait a bit.
- **TĪNG** (The Shard): A Chinese restaurant on the 35th floor of The Shard. It's expensive, but the food is really good and the views are amazing. You can see the whole city from up there, and it's a great place to take guests to. They also have a vegetarian menu!
- **Daisy Green**: My favourite breakfast spot - Australian restaurants with locations in most parts of the city. They serve the typical avocado toast, but also other dishes like pancakes and eggs. Highly recommend: Blueberry Butter Milk Pancakes.
- **Natural Fitness Food**: Looking for some healthy takeaway? Natural Fitness Food's got you covered. They have a bunch of different dishes focusing on different nutritional aspects (such as "bulk" and "energy"), and they're all really good. They also have a few locations, located in the "Third Space" gyms.
- **Fuwa Fuwa**: Japanese soufflé pancakes! Super fluffy & yummy!

### Things to do

Well, even though London is a big city, it's still Europe. There's not _that_ much to do - you can go out, walk around and eat. There are museums, art galleries, libraries, and other things to look at. I spent most of the time working. There are many different areas of the city that you can explore; there is about a subculture for just about everything you could be interested in. Honestly I didn't really do much - but I'm sure you could find things to do if you wanted.

## London - a city with problems

Oh, here we go. London is a nice city, but it's definitely not perfect. A few examples:

- Public transport: Delays, disruptions, strikes, chaos. For the entirety of 2023 (and even before that I think), taking the tube is a bit of a gamble. Will it run? Will it be late? Is it closed? You never know. There are a lot of strikes - these are usually announced in advance. But even then, it still sucks if half of the city suddenly shuts down. And then there are also a lot of technical disruptions that lead to lots of delays, cancellations etc.
- Weather: A lot of rain, as expected, but it can also get super hot!
- It's expensive! Rent is expensive, food is expensive, everything is expensive. You can get by with around £2000 per month, but that's not a lot. If you want to live in a nice area, you'll have to pay a lot more. My flat (studio) was around £1700 per month - and that's not even in a super nice area. Central yes, but there were still lots of crazy people wandering the streets at night.
- Just the general availability of things. Try to find something to eat after 10pm, or groceries. Good luck! This isn't really specific to London, just Europe in general.

So, will I be back? Sure - to visit. It's a nice city to visit for a few days. But I don't think I'll be living there again anytime soon.
